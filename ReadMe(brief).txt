Copilot did all the heavy lifting when it came to designing the database (InventoryControlDB):

1. It designed the tables and relationships and created a sql script to drop all tables (if they exist) and recreate them which was handy when adding or modifying tables.
2. It also created a sample data sql script to populate the new tables. This made it easy to start over and re-populate after modifying tables.
3. I asked it to design a Console menu with various report options and it did that too, making it easy to test different sql scripts by generating various reports with filtering options included.
4. It even documented how to go about setting up the Database for testing whether you're using MySQL, MySQL Workbench, or the Windows PowerShell/Command Prompt.
5. Stored Procedures and Database Indexes were created for sql optimization.
6. When asked to debug and optimize sql queries it did just that.
7. When asked to change the format of reports into a grid/table format it handled it.
8. It created ReadMe.md with over 1000 lines of information, so I created this to scale it down.
9. Copilot was there every step of the way!
