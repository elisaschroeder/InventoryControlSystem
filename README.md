# Inventory Control System

A console application for an Inventory Control System designed to practice Advanced SQL concepts.

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive inventory management system that demonstrates advanced SQL database operations, including complex queries, stored procedures, triggers, and data relationships. The application is being developed as a learning tool to explore and master SQL concepts in a practical, real-world scenario.

## Current Status

**Project Phase:** Initial Planning

The project is currently in its early stages. The following has been completed:
- ✅ Repository initialized
- ✅ Basic project structure defined
- ✅ Documentation framework established

### What's Been Produced So Far

As of now, the repository contains:
- Basic README documentation describing the project goals
- Git repository structure with proper version control setup

### Planned Development

The following components are planned for future development:
- Database schema design for inventory management
- Console application interface for user interaction
- SQL scripts demonstrating advanced concepts:
  - Complex JOIN operations
  - Subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
  - Stored procedures for business logic
  - Triggers for data validation and automation
  - Indexing strategies for performance optimization
  - Transaction management
- Sample data for testing and demonstration
- Comprehensive documentation of SQL concepts demonstrated

## Technology Stack (Planned)

- **Database:** SQL Server / PostgreSQL / MySQL (to be determined)
- **Application Language:** C# / Python / Java (to be determined)
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## Project Goals

1. Design and implement a normalized database schema for inventory management
2. Create advanced SQL queries demonstrating complex database operations
3. Implement stored procedures, functions, and triggers
4. Build a console application to interact with the database
5. Document SQL concepts and best practices learned throughout development

## Future Features

The inventory control system will eventually support:
- Product catalog management
- Stock level tracking and alerts
- Supplier and warehouse management
- Order processing and fulfillment
- Inventory reporting and analytics
- Multi-location inventory support
