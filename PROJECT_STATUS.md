- [x] Documentation framework created
- [x] Version control configured

## In Progress

- [ ] Comprehensive README documentation
- [ ] Database schema design
- [ ] Technology stack selection
- [ ] Application development setup

## Planned Next Steps

1. **Database Design**
   - Design entity-relationship diagram (ERD)
   - Create normalized database schema
   - Define tables for products, inventory, suppliers, warehouses, orders
   - Establish relationships and constraints

2. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Select and install database management system
   - Choose programming language for console application
   - Set up development tools and IDE
   - Configure database connection

3. **Core SQL Development**
   - Create database and tables
   - Develop stored procedures for CRUD operations
   - Implement triggers for business rules
   - Write complex queries demonstrating SQL concepts

4. **Application Development**
   - Design console interface
   - Implement menu system
   - Create database interaction layer
   - Add error handling and validation

5. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Generate sample test data
   - Test all database operations
   - Document SQL concepts demonstrated
   - Create user guide

## Milestones

## Technologies Under Consideration

### Database Options
- **SQL Server**: Excellent for learning T-SQL, stored procedures, and advanced features
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source, powerful, great for advanced SQL
- **MySQL**: Popular, widely used, good for learning fundamentals

### Application Language Options
- **C#**: Native integration with SQL Server, strong typing, excellent tooling
- **Python**: Simple syntax, good database libraries (psycopg2, pyodbc)
- **Java**: Enterprise-grade, JDBC support, cross-platform

## Challenges and Considerations

- Selecting appropriate technology stack for learning goals
- Balancing complexity vs. clarity in SQL examples
- Ensuring database design supports all planned advanced SQL concepts
- Creating realistic sample data for testing

## Resources and Learning Goals

This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in:
- Database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- Complex JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, CROSS)
- Subqueries and derived tables
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and recursive queries
- Window functions and analytical queries
- Stored procedures and functions
- Triggers for data integrity
- Indexing strategies
- Query optimization
- Transaction management and ACID properties
